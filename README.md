Release automation for pandas.

The release process is automated using GitHub actions, but triggered manually see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow#manually-running-a-workflow

To perform the release process using a local machine follow the steps in linux-mac.md or windows.md
